# Face-Detection-USing-OpenCV
Here we are feeding our model with an input test data of images and it is detecting the faces that are present in the image. The libraries used are opencv, dlib, face_recognition and cmake

I have mounted my google drive in the code and inserted test data and the dataset from it

The results are as follows
